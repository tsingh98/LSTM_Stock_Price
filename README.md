# LSTM_Stock_Price

This project aims to create momentum indicators on a set of 10 tickers and utilise a long short-term memory neural network framework to predict the stock price evolution for each ticker. The recurrent nature of LSTM makes them a natural choice for such a task where the temporal nature of the data contributes significantly.
